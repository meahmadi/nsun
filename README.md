when you are exist in virtual world

My robot:

  1.Track all my activities.
  2.Process the activities:
  
    a)sort them by how much time do they need.
    b)sort them by how much the outcome is useful.
    c)compute them and detect the best activity to do now by time and result.
    
  3.persuade me to do the detected activity (got no idea how to do it yet).
  4.get the feed back of doing that activity and compute how much the activity processing was successful:
  
    a)if successful make that detection algorithm more powerful.
    b)if not, find the reason that why it was not the suitable activity,
    change the algorithm in a way not to repeat that problem.
